# SkinCancerCNN-GUI
 A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model designed to predict skin cancer from images, integrated with an intuitive GUI for easy use. This project aims to assist in early detection by providing a user-friendly tool for analyzing skin lesions. Built with [insert frameworks, e.g., TensorFlow/Keras, Tkinter/PyQt], it includes the model, GUI, and instructions for setup and usage


The dataset you used (e.g., ISIC dataset, if applicable).
How accurate your model is (e.g., "Achieves X% accuracy on validation data").
Instructions: Include clear steps to install dependencies (e.g., pip install -r requirements.txt) and run the GUI.
Screenshots: Add a screenshot of the GUI in action—it’ll grab attention!
